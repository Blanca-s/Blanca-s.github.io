I am a MPhile student in CUHKSZ and my research interest lies in LLMs field, understanding LLMs, better training them to help people better deploy them within a lower cost. Feel free to reach me throw my E-mail and look me up on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oXwixe0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and my [CV](https://blanca-s.github.io/cv/). 

# Research Interest
As a MPhile student in the first-year of my two-year master study, I spent my time on optimizing the vanilla GRPO algorithm so that it could be better implemented on small-sized LLMs. Additionally, I am keen on the explainability of LLMs because I once visualized the attention score matrices of one specific LLM during its inference and I was very curious about why they looked like that and I hoped to find out how that could benifit the LLM community.
- Reasoning with LLMs.
- Attention mechanism in LLMs.
- Explainability of LLMs. 

# More about me
I did my MPhile research at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am gratefule to have been co-advised by my senior Yongxin Guo and my professor Xiaoying Tang. Under their support, I accomplished a research on optimizing the implementation of GRPO algorithm on small-sized LLMs. Before that, I did my undergraduate studies at Hefei University of Technology (Project 211 University) and got a very good GPA there.
